There are a few things to keep in mind when executing these transactions:\n *  - Approvals will have the `approval` action specified. You can perform approvals with `sendAndConfirmTransaction`, then proceed to the next transaction.\n *  - All transactions are assumed to be executed by the `sender` address, regardless of which chain they are on. The final transaction will use the `receiver` as the recipient address.\n *  - If an `expiration` timestamp is provided, all transactions must be executed before that time to guarantee successful execution at the specified price.\n *\n * NOTE: To get the status of each non-approval transaction, use `Bridge.status` rather than checking for transaction inclusion. This function will ensure full completion of the transfer.\n *\n * You can access this functions input and output types with `Transfer.prepare.Options` and `Transfer.prepare.Result`, respectively.\n *\n * You can include arbitrary data to be included on any webhooks and status responses with the `purchaseData` option.\n *\n * ```ts\n * const quote = await Bridge.Transfer.prepare({\n *   chainId: 1,\n *   tokenAddress: NATIVE_TOKEN_ADDRESS,\n *   amount: toWei(\"0.01\"),\n *   sender: \"0x...\",\n *   receiver: \"0x...\",\n *   purchaseData: {\n *     reference: \"payment-123\",\n *     metadata: {\n *       note: \"Transfer to Alice\"\n *     }\n *   },\n *   client: thirdwebClient,\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * ## Fees\n * There may be fees associated with the transfer. These fees are paid by the `feePayer` address, which defaults to the `sender` address. You can specify a different address with the `feePayer` option. If you do not specify an option or explicitly specify `sender`, the fees will be added to the input amount. If you specify the `receiver` as the fee payer the fees will be subtracted from the destination amount.\n *\n * For example, if you were to request a transfer with `feePayer` set to `receiver`:\n * ```typescript\n * const quote = await Bridge.Transfer.prepare({\n *   chainId: 1,\n *   tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\", // USDC\n *   amount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC\n *   sender: \"0x...\",\n *   receiver: \"0x...\",\n *   feePayer: \"receiver\",\n *   client: thirdwebClient,\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * The returned quote might look like:\n * ```typescript\n * {\n *   originAmount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC\n *   destinationAmount: 99_970_000n, // 99.97 USDC\n *   ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * If you were to request a transfer with `feePayer` set to `sender`:\n * ```typescript\n * const quote = await Bridge.Transfer.prepare({\n *   chainId: 1,\n *   tokenAddress: \"0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48\", // USDC\n *   amount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC\n *   sender: \"0x...\",\n *   receiver: \"0x...\",\n *   feePayer: \"sender\",\n *   client: thirdwebClient,\n * });\n * ```\n *\n * The returned quote might look like:\n * ```typescript\n * {\n *   originAmount: 100_030_000n, // 100.03 USDC\n *   destinationAmount: 100_000_000n, // 100 USDC\n *   ...\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * @param options - The options for the quote.\n * @param options.chainId - The chain ID of the token.\n * @param options.tokenAddress - The address of the token.\n * @param options.amount - The amount of the token to transfer.\n * @param options.sender - The address of the sender.\n * @param options.receiver - The address of the recipient.\n * @param options.purchaseData - Arbitrary data to be passed to the transfer function and included with any webhooks or status calls.\n * @param options.client - Your thirdweb client.\n * @param [options.feePayer] - The address that will pay the fees for the transfer.
