## Phase 1: Foundation & Credibility (Pre-Launch / Weeks 1-4)

**Goal:** Build trust, establish authority, and create core marketing assets.

1.  **Smart Contract Audit (Non-negotiable):**
    *   **Action:** Commission a full security audit from a reputable firm (e.g., Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, Spearbit, CertiK).
    *   **Marketing Value:** The audit is the single most important marketing asset. It demonstrates a commitment to security and builds user confidence.

2.  **Build in Public & Content Marketing:**
    *   **Action:** Launch official Twitter and blog (Medium/Mirror) channels.
    *   **Content Strategy:**
        *   **Educational:** Explain flash loan arbitrage, the bot's architecture, and the choice of the Base network.
        *   **Transparency:** Write a post-mortem on the Aerodrome bug, detailing the problem, debugging process, and solution. This builds immense credibility.
        *   **Performance:** Share honest, aggregated results from dry-runs and testing.

3.  **Develop the "Alpha" Dashboard:**
    *   **Action:** Create a simple, clean, read-only web interface using the existing WebSocket server.

## Phase 2: Initial Launch & Community Seeding (Weeks 5-8)

**Goal:** Attract the first cohort of users and prove the bot's effectiveness with real capital.

1.  **"Founding Farmer" Program:**
    *   **Action:** The development team must be the first to deposit a significant amount of capital into the bot's vault.
    *   **Marketing Action:** Publicly track the performance of these internal funds on the dashboard and Twitter for 1-2 weeks before opening the vault to the public. This demonstrates confidence in the product.

2.  **Community Hub (Discord):**
    *   **Action:** Create a Discord server for announcements, user support, and community engagement.
    *   **Key Channels:** #announcements, #general, #support, #trade-feed (automated from the bot), #suggestions.
